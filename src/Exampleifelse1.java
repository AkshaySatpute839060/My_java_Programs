/*
if-else statement
The syntax of an if-else statement in c looks like that of
c++ and javascript java has a similar syntax too.
    It looks like:
    if(condition-to-be-checked)
    {Statements-if-condition-true;
    }
    else{
            statements-if-condition-false;
            }[else is optional]
    # Relational operators in java
    Relational operators are used to evaluate condition
    (true or false) inside the if statements.
        Some examples of relational operators are:

         ==,         >=,         >, >=,      !=
         equals   greater than               not equals
                  or eq. to

            Note : '=' is used for assignment where as '=='
            is used for equalitt check.
